Project's (eventual) home: http://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/evaluated-flet/


Provides alternatives to FLET and FLET* that behave analogously to LET
and LET* except they bind values in the function namespace. Intended
to reduce conceptual differences between lexical binding of variables
and functions. Makes functional programming more natural in some
cases.
